# Week 1: Python Practice for Robotics ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

This repository contains my Python practice for Week 1 of learning towards robotics engineering.

All practice is in one file:
- `week1_python_practice.py`

## âœ… Topics covered:
- Day 1: Input & Output
- Day 2: Conditional statements and loops
- Day 3: Functions
- Day 4: Lists & Dictionaries
- Day 5: Classes & Objects
- Day 6: File Handling

âœ¨ Learning step by step toward my goal to become a Robotics Engineer in 2026!


## Week 2: OOP, Exceptions & Mini Project
- `week2_mini_project.py`: Mini project â€” create motor, calculate speed, save to log
- `robot_utils.py`: Helper functions like calculate_speed


 Weekâ€¯3: Sensors & Control Basics
This week I built:

sensors.py: classes for IR sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and camera sensor

sensor_data.py: simulated sensor readings collected in list & dictionary

control_logic.py: robot decides to stop, slow down, or move based on readings

robot_simulation.py: simulates multiple time steps with changing distance

obstacle_avoidance.py: mini project with random sensor data & robot reaction

ðŸš€ Key skills learned:
âœ… Classes & objects for sensors
âœ… Using loops & conditions to control robot actions
âœ… Random data to simulate real-world conditions
âœ… Step-by-step simulation over time
